Pyres-django
============

## About
[Pyres](https://github.com/binarydud/pyres) is an excellent attempt of porting the [Resque](http://github.com/defunkt/resque) job queue to python.
**Pyres-django** aims to be just a small collection of helpers for simple integration of pyres to [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

## IMPORTANT

Pyres-django is yet unstable and perhaps not completely production-ready solution.
Basically, this is just a set of my own shortcuts moved to a separate django application.

## INSTALLATION

 1. Ensure that Pyres is installed and working.
 2. Checkout the app code to your project path:
    ```git clone git://github.com/ruthenium/pyres_django.git```
 3. Add 'pyres_django' to your INSTALLED_APPS.
 4. If needed, set the REDIS_HOST and REDIS_PORT config settings.

And that's it! Now everything should work.

## System requirements

 1. [Redis](http://redis.io/) server.
 2. [Pyres](https://github.com/binarydud/pyres) and its dependencies.
 3. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) 1.3 or higher (because of class-based views in the web ui).

## USAGE

### Adding job to a queue:

Import the get_pyres helper:

```from pyres_django import get_pyres```

Then anywhere in your code just do:

```get_pyres().enqueue(SomeJob, *some_args)```

### Starting pyres worker:

Just type into your console:

```$ QUEUES=q1,q2 python2 manage.py pyres_worker```

And worker should run.
If you would like to permanently define a queues list for it, you can set the PYRES_QUEUES variable in your settings.py.

### Web Interface:

Include pyres_django's urls.py as you usually do in your global urls.py:

```urlpatterns = patterns('', url('^my-prefix/', include('pyres_django.urls')), )```

And now it will be available under your specified prefix.

## NOTE

According to the current implementation of the original ResWeb, It is not possible to use it
under django without any patches. So I've had to re-implement the resweb-functionality my own way.
It is still a "quick-and-dirty" solution, and I don't plan to develop it further, because the API of
pyres is still not stablized and the ability of wsgi-integration of course will present in future versions.

Although, the basic implementation of a "True-way" wsgi integration can be found in the "wsgi" branch of this app.
